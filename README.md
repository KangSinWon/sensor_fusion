# sensor_fusion
This project studies sensor fusion using lidar and cameras.

## TODO LIST
### DATA UTILS
- ~~lidar projected onto a camera (jupyter)~~
- ~~2d bbox on camera (jupyter)~~
- ~~3d bounding box on camera (jupyter)~~
- ~~lidar on top view (jupyter)~~
- ~~2d bbox on top view (jupyter)~~
- 3d bounding box on 3D
- camera projected onto lidar on 3D

### ML
- later....
